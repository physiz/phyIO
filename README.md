# What is PhyIO

PhyIO is an IoT development board with ARM cortex-M4 MCU and CC3100 WiFi chipset. It is designed for tinkerers who need high processing and good wireless connectivity for their IoT projects.

Multiple onboard interfaces like I2C, UART, SPI, and RS485 make it easy to experiment with various sensors and actuators. With its extensive features and rugged design, there are endless possibilities.
